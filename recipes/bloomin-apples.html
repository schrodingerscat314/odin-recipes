            This fun and interactive dessert transforms 
            a Honeycrisp apple into a show-stopping treat. 
            We brush each apple petal with buttery apple pie sauce,
            then bake them until they're perfectly tender and syrupy-sweet.
            Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and you've got a cozy dessert.

                <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons apple pie spice blend</li>
                <li>8 medium soft caramel squares, such as Werther's</li>
                <li>vanilla ice cream</li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 class="headers">Directions</h2>
        <p>
            <ol class="lists">
                <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat oven
                    to 375 degrees F.
                </li>
                <li>Slice off the top 1/2-inch of each apple. Using an apple corer,
                    a melon baller, or a teaspoon, remove core, 
                    starting at the top of each apple
                    and stopping about 1 inch from the bottom of the apple.
                </li>
                <li>Using a paring knife or a round cookie cutter, cut
                    2 concentric circles 1/4-inch apart outward from core, 
                    cutting as deep as possible without cutting all the way
                    through bottom of apple.
                </li>
                <li>Working from the top of the apple, cut vertically
                    into 8 equal slices, leaving apple intact 1/2 inch from
                    bottom.
                </li>
                <li>In a small bowl, whisk together butter, brown sugar,
                    and apple pie spice until well combined. Set aside. 
                </li>
                <li>Place apples in an 8-inch square baking dish.
                    Fill each apple with two caramel squares. Brush butter
                    mixture evenly over the tops of each apple. Pour boiling
                    apple around the apples to a depth of 1/4-inch in the bottom
                    of the dish. Cover with foil.
                </li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
                    Remove foil and continue to bake, uncovered, until sugar 
                    begins to caramelize and apples are tender when pierced
                    with a paring knife, 25 to 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Allow apples to cool for 10 minutes. Using your hands, 
                    gently spread apple "petals" apart. Serve warm or at room
                    temperature topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream
                    and a drizzle of caramel sauce. 
                </li>
