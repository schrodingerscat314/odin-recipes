        <p class="para">Apple pie tiramisu has all the flavor of 
            your favorite apple pie piled into a creamy, 
            layered treat. Ladyfingers are soaked in apple cider 
            instead of espresso. Toasted pecans add a nice 
            buttery crunch to each bite.

            <ol class="lists">
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Prepare the Apple Filling: Stir together apple pie fruit 
                    filling, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg in a bowl until well combined. 
                    Reserve 1/4 cup apple slices from the filling in a small bowl; 
                    roughly mash remaining apple mixture using a potato masher. Set aside. </li>
                <li>Prepare the Tiramisu: Place mascarpone in a large bowl; 
                    set aside. Combine cream, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, salt, and nutmeg in 
                    a second large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on medium-low 
                    speed until it starts to thicken, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to 
                    medium and beat until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Gently whisk a third of cream mixture into 
                    mascarpone just until combined and slightly loosened; 
                    fold in remaining cream mixture, in 2 additions using a 
                    whisk, until just combined.
                </li>
                <li>Pour apple cider in a shallow bowl. Quickly dip and roll 
                    ladyfingers in the cider, one by one, just until coated, about 1 
                    second each. Arrange 12 ladyfingers in a single layer on the bottom of an 
                    8-inch square baking dish; trim or break ladyfingers to fit as needed. 
                    Crumble and arrange any leftover ladyfinger pieces into the gaps and over 
                    the top. 
                </li>
                <li>Spread half of apple filling over ladyfingers. Drizzle evenly with 
                    2 tablespoons of the caramel sauce. Top with half of the mascarpone mixture, 
                    spreading into an even layer. Repeat layers once with remaining ladyfingers, 
                    cider, apple filling, caramel sauce, and mascarpone mixture, piling top high 
                    as needed and swooping into an even layer with the back of a spoon. Discard 
                    any remaining cider.
                </li>
                <li>Loosely cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate with reserved apple slices 
                    until set, for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.
                </li>
                <li>When ready to serve, chop reserved apple slices. Uncover 
                    and top tiramisu evenly with chopped apples and a drizzle of caramel sauce; 
                    garnish with pecans, is using.
